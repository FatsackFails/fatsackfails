# Hi, I'm Fatsack!

Since 2015 I've been sharing my passion for video games, graphic design, web development, tabletop roleplaying, and weird eclectic music with my community on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/fatsackfails). During that time I've been slowly learning web development and design as I make things related to my Twitch channel. 

At [Somehow Qualified](https://github.com/Somehow-Qualified) we're building [Stream Sites](https://github.com/Somehow-Qualified/stream-sites): a free, open source stack to give content creators a web presence that they can own forever.
