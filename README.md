# Hi, I'm Fatsack!

Since 2015 I've been sharing my passion for video games, graphic design, web development, tabletop roleplaying, and weird eclectic music with my community on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/fatsackfails). During that time I've been slowly learning web development and design as I make things related to my Twitch channel. 

At [Somehow Qualified](https://github.com/Somehow-Qualified) we're building [Stream Sites](https://github.com/Somehow-Qualified/stream-sites): a free, open source stack to give content creators a web presence that they can own forever.

Stream Sites is Open Source under the MIT license, so feel free to use any of the code from my personal Stream Site as inspiration in your own work. The content contained within belongs to me, unless otherwise noted.
