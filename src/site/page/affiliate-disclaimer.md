This page serves as a general disclaimer to you that I may link to certain products or services with affiliate links. An affiliate link (sometimes called a referral link) is a specific URL that supports me in some way when you click through. Affiliate links can be used to sign up for, purchase, or otherwise use the product or service I share.

These affiliate links do not have an additional cost to you when you use them. The link tells the people behind the product or service I share that you are coming over to them on my recommendation, and I'm compensated for doing so.

That being said, I only recommend products or services that I have either used myself or have researched fully and trust to share with you. Any opinions I have with affiliated products are my honest thoughts. I believe disclosing affiliate links is important for you to make informed decisions for the products and services you use.

Disclosing affiliate links is also [required by the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking). I have done my best to ensure they are disclosed properly. Don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact) if you have any questions or concerns about the affiliate links I share, both here on the website, as well as on social media or on Discord.
