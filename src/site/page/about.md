I started streaming in 2015 as a way to scratch an itch that I could no longer scratch in the real world due to a busy schedule and other responsibilities. I was very active with musical theater throughout high school, and I tried to pursue theater further after graduating. Unfortunately, due to becoming an adult™ I could no longer afford the time and money needed to be involved with theater productions.

Streaming on Twitch allows me to have that moment in the spotlight again, with less time and money that has to be invested up front. It also allows me to be the attention whore that I so desperately have to be.

I'm not a pro-player in any sense of the word, and very often fail miserably at the game at hand. I don't get angry very easily, so I try to turn my failures into the audience's entertainment. We keep a tally of how often I've died, and hand out chat points for spectacular fails.

I've taken a casual approach to streaming, with a fairly laid back attitude for everything involved in it. The rules for my channel are pretty basic: treat others how you would like to be treated.

I play a lot of different types of games. If there isn't a whole lot of spoken dialogue in a game, I like to read the text out loud with different voices and turn it into a performance. I enjoy games that I can tinker with using mods like Skyrim and Fallout.

RPGs, rhythm games, adventure games, shooters, MOBAs, visual novels, I enjoy an eclectic assortment of games. Tabletop RPGs become mini-performances when I play them. Expect silly voices, ACTING™, and other aspects to make the experience of watching as enjoyable as possible.

I enjoy writing homebrew for the Tabletop RPG games I play and sharing them for others to use in their own games.

When I'm not streaming I'm enjoy reading, comics, podcasts, video essays, as well as working on my craft as a jack of all trades designer.

I also like to design my own emotes, overlays, sound effects, and artwork for my channel. I enjoy learning how to make things and sharing that knowledge with others.
