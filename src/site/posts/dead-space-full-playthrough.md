You are Isaac Clarke aboard the USG Ishimura, a Planetcracker ship that's having a few problems. One of those problems is the dead crew members are coming back to life as Necromorphs. The other is you're trapped on the ship with them. Using Isaac's skills you'll shoot, punch, and stomp your way through the different areas of the ship, repairing broken systems and clearing hoards of the dead.
