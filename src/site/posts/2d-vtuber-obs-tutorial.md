This PNGTuber effect requires Exeldro's [Move Transition Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/). That means it only works with OBS Studio, and not SLOBS or any other broadcast software.

If you use this effect on your stream I'd love to see it! Tag me on [social media](https://twitter.com/fatsackfails) with a clip.
