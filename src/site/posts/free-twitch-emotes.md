Finally unlocked Twitch Affiliate status and need some sweet Sub Emotes for your channel? Want to spice up your Discord, Guilded, or Slack channels? You came to the right place! This FREE Sub Emote pack comes with 41 different Emotes for you to immediately upload to your channel today! These Emotes are designed to fit nicely with my [Sub Loyalty Badges](/badges) as well as my [Sub Badge Flairs](/flairs) I made.

There's enough variety to have an Emote for every Sub Tier plus some variants for the Bits Tier Emotes Twitch rolled out. Use these awesome Emotes temporarily while you work on your own, or use them forever!

Includes the source file to personalize them with brand colors, change out shapes, or just peek under the hood at how you might want to go about making Emotes yourself.



## Updated! New Emotes!
I've updated this pack with 16 new emotes! Just redownload to get them. These new emotes are still [CC By 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and still include a source file so you can make your own adjustments. If you like these emotes, **please rate them**! This helps get more eyeballs on my work. Thank you everyone for downloading and rating!

If you're just using the Emotes for your channel and don't plan on editing them and/or sharing them with others, you don't have to worry about this. Simply use the Emotes and enjoy!



## Using the Emotes
To upload these Emotes to your Twitch channel, go to your *Creator Dashboard* and navigate to *Viewer Rewards >> Emotes*. From there you can upload the images found in the 'Sub Emotes' folder for each image size (or just use the largest image if using the auto-resize option.)

I've labeled the images in order, as well as labeled the image size for each Emote. You can either click each Emote size to find and upload from the file picker, or you can drag and drop each image. Make sure to save your changes and you're set! Enjoy the new Sub Emotes.

Discord and Guilded need to navigate to *Server Settings >> Emojis* or *Settings >> Emotes* respectively. Slack can add emojis using the *Add Emoji* button in the emoji picker.


## Editing the Emotes
In the 'Source and Previews' folder is an Affinity Designer (.afdesign) file used to create these Emotes. You will need [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) to be able to open and edit this file. I've set up each Emote in its own labeled artboard. Make any changes you want, like colors, shapes, etc. and then export the images.

Remember you need to export as PNG for the transparency and you need to export each Emote three times at the different image sizes (112x112, 56x56, and 28x28) if you're not using the auto-resize option in Twitch's Emote uploader tool.

If you can't or don't want to use Affinity Designer (you should, it's great) the preview images are PNG format at 1080x1080 that you can pull into whatever image editor you want to use to make changes. I recommend using [Photopea](https://photopea.com) because it's a free Photoshop alternative that you can use in your browser.
