A quick showcase of the overlay used for the Diablo II Median XL streams. Lots of photoshopping in-game UI elements, sourcing old promo pictures and stitching them together, and recreating textures to fit the screen resolution. Then tracking down fonts that are both licensed free to use and close to the ones used in game. The alerts are sourced from the in game audio files I pulled and edited with Audacity. Finally stock fire footage was edited in DaVinci Resolve and everything was layered together in SLOBS for what you see here!
