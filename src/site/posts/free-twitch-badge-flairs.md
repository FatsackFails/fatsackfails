If you're just using these Badge Flairs for your channel and don't plan on editing them and/or sharing them with others, you don't have to worry about this. Simply use the flairs and enjoy!

## Using the Flairs
To use these Sub Badge Flairs for your Twitch channel, go to your Creator Dashboard and navigate to *Settings >> Affiliate >> Loyalty Badges >> Upload Custom Flair*. From there you can upload the images found in the 'Badge Flair' folder for each image size.

I've labeled image size for the size for each flair. You can either click each the upload button and use the file picker, or you can drag and drop each image. Make sure to save your changes and you're set! Enjoy the new Sub Badge Flairs.

## Editing the Flairs
In the 'Source and Previews' folder is an Affinity Designer (.afdesign) file used to create these Flairs. You will need [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) to be able to open and edit this file. I've set up each Flair in its own labeled artboard, as well as labeled each piece of the badge in the layers. Make any changes you want, like colors, shapes, etc. and then export the images.

Remember you need to export as PNG for the transparency and you need to export each Flair three times at the different image sizes (72x72, 36x36, and 18x18).

If you can't or don't want to use Affinity Designer (you should, it's great) the preview images are PNG format at 1080x1080 that you can pull into whatever image editor you want to use to make changes. I recommend using [Photopea](https://photopea.com) because it's a free Photoshop alternative that you can use in your browser.
