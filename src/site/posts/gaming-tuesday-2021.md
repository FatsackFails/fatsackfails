## Milestones
- $1 - FIRST dollar donated!
- $500 - at 50% of our goal we'll celebrate with a Batsack stream!
- $1000 - at 100% of our goal we'll celebrate with a #MorphsuitHype stream!
- Beyond? - If we go over our initial goal, we'll add more milestones!

This will be my third year participating in Save The Children's #GamingTuesday charity event. From November 23 until December 7, I'll be <a href="https://donate.tiltify.com/@fatsackfails/fatsackfails-gaming-tuesday-2021" target="_blank">running charity streams</a> to raise money. Save The Children has been <a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/us/what-we-do" target="_blank">helping children for over 100 years</a> all across the world.

Last year we raised $1000 dollars for the event, over double our original $400 goal. This year I'm hoping we can raise at least $1000 again, so I'll need your help! Please donate what you can, even if it's only a few dollars.

According to Save The Children, even just $1 can provide four children with pneumonia treatment, so every little bit helps. Please share this with your friends and family and encourage them to donate as well.

You can donate at any time, but if you do during one of my Twitch livestreams, a special alert will pop up announcing your donation!

If we meet the $1000 goal we'll celebrate with a special MorphsuitHype stream where I wear a silly hot pink spandex morphsuit for the whole stream! We may even have more special surprises if we surpass the initial goal!
