Psychological horror awaits you in Visage. You are Dwayne Anderson. As you explore a house in the 1980's, you learn about the backstories of the previous people who lived there. The more you learn, the angrier the spirits who reside there become. Find the keys to unlock the rooms you need access to escape, while dealing with your own sanity and the violent spirits lurking through the house.
