I wanted some Make It Rain style animations for my alerts, so I made these! I thought I'd share them with you so you can use them too. Add them to your alerts, videos, etc. Includes vertical cropped versions too!

## Using the Animations
Included are 24 WEBM video files. A set of 12 videos at 720p and a set at 1080p. They're categorized into folders and labeled. Each set has 6 videos meant for full screen 16:9 aspect play, and 6 videos meant for 9:16 aspect "vertical cam" play.

The animations include raining confetti, gifts, bits, coins, dollar bills, and a combo of coins and dollar bills.

You can add them to OBS directly to play as you see fit, or add them to StreamElements or Streamlabs as part of an alert, or any other use case. Each video is 3 seconds long and transparent.
