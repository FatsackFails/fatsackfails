You are the Painter. You have returned to your old Victorian home, abandoned and empty, to finish your Magnum Opus. Your masterpiece. Once you finish it, it will all be worth it. The pain, the madness, the loss. But first you must collect your tools from the various rooms of the house and work on your art. Things are not as they seem, with doors closing behind you, hallways disappearing and reappearing before your very eyes, and the cries of anguish and torture of your loved ones echoing through the musty hallways. But you must finish it. Use my affiliate link here to [check out the game for yourself](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/layers-of-fear-masterpiece-edition?partner=fatsackfails).
