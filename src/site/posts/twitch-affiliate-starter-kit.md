Hitting Affiliate status is a great achievement, but the cost of getting custom artwork can be expensive (sometimes over $100) for emotes, badges, flairs, and channel points. Not to mention the time it'll take for those designs to be ready to use. My Twitch Affiliate Starter Kit will help you cover the basics as you figure out your next move.

Let your community celebrate right away without the pressure of having to find an artist to commission. Use the designs as placeholders for the time being, or as a base to build on for custom artwork. Over 100+ artwork elements already sized and organized to upload to your Creator Dashboard the moment you download. Pay what you want starting at $10 USD.

## Includes:

- Badges up to 5 years of Subs

- 30 Flairs for Tier 2 and Tier 3 Subs

- 40+ Emotes

- 100+ Channel Point designs (can be used as Emotes and Badges too!)

- License to modify, remix, and share designs outside of Twitch (no credit needed)

- Properly sized, labeled, and organized images for each design

- HD sized versions of each design (1080x1080 pixels)

- Source files to modify designs in Affinity Designer

- Instructions to upload to Twitch
