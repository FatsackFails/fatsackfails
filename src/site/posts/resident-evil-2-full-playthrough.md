Raccoon City, September 1998. 2 months after Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus has ravaged the city, almost everyone is a mindless flesh eating zombie. Follow Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield navigate the zombie infested city and try not to get eaten. Oh and they also need to avoid an unstoppable killing machine, codename "Tyrant", that is hunting them. Good luck.
