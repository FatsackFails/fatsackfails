  Once again from November 24th till December 8th, I'm raising funds for [Save
  The Children's](https://www.savethechildren.org/) #GamingTuesday charity
  event.


  This will directly benefit COVID relief for children as well as other much needed help. Please consider making a donation, even a dollar, and sharing this with your friends and family.

Here we go again! Once more I'm helping the Save The Children's #GamingTuesday charity event. That means from November 24th until December 8th, I'll be <a href="https://tiltify.com/@fatsackfails/fatsack-fails-gaming-tuesday-2020/donate" target="_blank">fundraising and running charity streams</a> on the channel to raise money. 2020 has been a rough year for many people across the globe, and Save The Children is working <a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/us/what-we-do" target="_blank">to provide COVID relief and many other benefits</a> to children all across the world.

Last year we raised $400 dollars for the event, doubling our original goal. This year I'm hoping we can raise at least $400 again, so I'll need your help! Please donate what you can, even if it's only a few dollars.

According to Save The Children, even just $1 can provide four children with pneumonia treatment, so every little bit helps. Please share this with your friends and family and encourage them to donate as well.

You can donate at any time, but if you do during one of my Twitch livestreams, a special alert will pop up announcing your donation!

If we meet the $400 goal before the Giving Tuesday holiday, December 1st, we'll celebrate with a special MorphsuitHype stream where I wear a silly hot pink spandex morphsuit for the whole stream! We may even have more special surprises if we surpass the initial goal!

<h2>Stretch Goals!</h2>
<p>We met the $400 goal on the first night! So here are some new stretch goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="">$800 Fatsack Fails at Phasmophobia - PhasMORPHobia Stream</li>
  <li class="">$1200 Fatsack Fails at Dark Souls w/ Crowd Control - Prepare to Die</li>
</ul>
