Just hit Twitch Affiliate and need to set up your Sub Badges? I got you covered! Use these free Sub Loyalty Badges to start hyping up your community. Use them as a temporary stand-in, or forever!

## Update!
Twitch recently updated Sub Badges to go up to 5 years for Affiliates! I've updated the pack to include these extra years. Everything's still free, and still licensed CC BY 4.0!

This bundle includes badges for: Base Subscriber, 2 Months, 3 Months, 6 Months, 9 Months, 1 Year, 2 Years, 3 Years, 4 Years, and 5 Years.

Use the source file to personalize them with brand colors, change out shapes, or just peek under the hood at how you might want to go about making Badges yourself.

Make sure to also check out my free [Sub Badge Flairs](/flairs) and [Sub Emotes](/emotes) to go along with these! If you like these badges, **please rate them**! This helps get more eyeballs on my work. Thank you everyone for downloading and rating!

If you're just using the Badges for your channel and don't plan on editing them and/or sharing them with others, you don't have to worry about this. Simply use the badges and enjoy!



## Using the Badges
To use these Sub Loyalty Badges for your Twitch channel, go to your Creator Dashboard and navigate to *Settings >> Affiliate >> Subscriber Badges*. From there you can upload the images found in the 'Badges' folder for each image size.

I've labeled the images in order, as well as labeled the image size for each badge. You can either click each Badge size to find and upload from the file picker, or you can drag and drop each image. Make sure to save your changes and you're set! Enjoy the new Sub Loyalty Badges.



## Editing the Badges
In the 'Source and Previews' folder is an Affinity Designer (.afdesign) file used to create these Badges. You will need [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) to be able to open and edit this file. I've set up each Badge in its own labeled artboard, as well as labeled each piece of the badge in the layers. Make any changes you want, like colors, shapes, etc. and then export the images.

Remember you need to export as PNG for the transparency and you need to export each Badge three times at the different image sizes (72x72, 36x36, and 18x18).

If you can't or don't want to use Affinity Designer (you should, it's great) the preview images are PNG format at 1080x1080 that you can pull into whatever image editor you want to use to make changes. I recommend using [Photopea](https://photopea.com) because it's a free Photoshop alternative that you can use in your browser.
