![Preview of over 100 designs. Caption reads, "Use for Channel Points, Rewards, Emotes, or Sub Badges!"](/images/free-twitch-channel-point-designs-preview.jpg)

Want to spice up your Channel Points? Need a design for that cool Reward you want your chat to spend points on? I GOT YOU COVERED!

I've created over 100 different designs for you to use for your Channel Point Icon and Channel Rewards! Many designs include 7 different color variations, as well as a few designs allowing you to add your own symbol or words if needed.

These designs also make for great extra Emotes for your channel! I've also included resized versions of these designs to use for Sub Badges if you want as well. These designs go well with my other resources, so be sure to [check them out](/category/products/)!

Includes the source files to personalize them with brand colors, change out shapes, or just peek under the hood at how you might want to go about making these yourself.

If you're just using the Emotes for your channel and don't plan on editing them and/or sharing them with others, you don't have to worry about this. Simply use the Emotes and enjoy!

## Using the Designs
These designs are sized for Channel Point Icons, Channel Point Rewards, Emotes, and Sub Badges. The folder labeled '02 Channel Points and Emote Sizes' are sized 112x112, 56x56, and 28x28. The folder labeled '03 Sub Badge Sizes' are sized 72x72, 36x36, and 18x18.

To set your Channel Point Icon for your Twitch channel, go to your *Creator Dashboard* and navigate to *Viewer Rewards >> Channel Points >> Customize Points Display*.

Channel Point Rewards can be customized by going to your *Creator Dashboard >> Viewer Rewards >> Channel Points >> Manage Rewards & Challenges*.

If you want to use these as Emotes you can upload them to your *Emote Library* by going to *Creator Dashboard >> Emotes* and clicking *Upload New* in the right hand panel.

Finally Sub Badges can be changed in *Creator Dashboard >> Settings >> Affiliate >> Subscriber Badges*.

From there you can upload the images found in the folders for each image size. I've labeled the images in order, as well as labeled the image size for each design. You can either click each design size to find and upload from the file picker, or you can drag and drop each image. Make sure to save your changes and you're set!



## Editing the Designs
In the '04 Source Files' folder are Affinity Designer (.afdesign) files used to create these designs. You will need [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) to be able to open and edit them. I've set up each design in its own labeled artboard. Make any changes you want, like colors, shapes, etc. and then export the images.

Remember you need to export as PNG for the transparency and you need to export each design three times at the different image sizes (112x112, 56x56, and 28x28 for channel points and emotes, 72x72, 36x36, and 18x18 for badges).

If you can't or don't want to use Affinity Designer (you should, it's great) the '01 Previews' folder has PNGs at 1080x1080 that you can pull into whatever image editor you want to use to make changes. I recommend using [Photopea](https://photopea.com) because it's a free Photoshop alternative that you can use in your browser.
