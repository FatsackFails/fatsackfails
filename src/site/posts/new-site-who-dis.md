Huzzah! If you're reading this that means I've made the move to Stream Sites! (or you hacked into my shit. GG2EZ) I've used a number of different website platforms in the past to put all of my Twitch stuff somewhere where folks can see info and updates. The issue with these other platforms was either the cost was too high for my poor streamer allowance to afford (#TimesIsHard) or there were limitations that restricted what I could put on my website or how I wanted it to look.

This lead me to try and build my website on my own. Like most things I attempt, I failed at it. Turns out making a website from scratch can be difficult! Who knew. The amount of time and knowledge required was a bit beyond me.

Eventually <a href="https://m2creates.com" target="_blank">M2</a> heard my cries of anguish (and high pitched whining) and together we created Stream Sites. Instead of building one website for me to put my stream stuff on, we've built a whole platform for anyone to be able to put their stream stuff on. You should check it out if you haven't already. <a href="https://streamsites.xyz" target="_blank">Stream Sites</a> is easy to use, simple to set up, and lets you get your hands dirty if you want to really trick out your site for a unique look or feature.

So yeah, I'll be putting all my stuff here! Get comfy, this is home now.
