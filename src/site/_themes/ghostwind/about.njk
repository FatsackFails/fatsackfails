You Are Here:
- About for Ghostwind
- src/site/_themes/ghostwind/about.njk

How It Works:
- On build, this page adds a form (if enabled)

Dynamic Data:
- anything in {{ curly braces }} is a variable from:
  (a) frontmatter in the associated markdown file (src/site/page/about.md)
  (b) src/site/_globals
#}
<section class="mx-auto">

  <h1 class="page-title text-5xl">{{ title }}</h1>

  <div class="content">

    {{ content | safe }}

    {% if form %}
      {% include "form.njk" %}
    {% endif %}

  </div>

</section>
